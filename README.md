# UFO_drought

There seems to be little consensus on what quantifies ecological drought, i.e. how much drier than normal does it need to be for a locality to be in drought? While we avoid these questions, we do calculate the two most common metrics of drought the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). Some discussion of the advantages of both, largely recapitulated from better sources is also done.
